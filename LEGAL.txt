Since this code was created with reference to decompiled Python code
from Ableton's 'MIDI Remote Scripts' folder, I cannot know whether the
code is licenseable or not as I don't know what the original Ableton script
code is licensed under.

However, the following message does appear in some of the Ableton Push code:
    
    Disclaimer: Any use of the Push control surface code (the "Code")
    or parts thereof for commercial purposes or in a commercial context
    is not allowed. Though we do not grant a license for non-commercial
    use of the Code, you may use it in this regard but should be aware that
    (1) we reserve the right to deny the future use any time and
    (2) you need to check whether the use is allowed under the national law
    applicable to your use.
	
While I have used no Push code in these scripts, it is probable that
some or all of the Ableton Live included Remote Scripts code falls under 
the same or a similar disclaimer.

Based on the above, here are my restrictions:
DO NOT COPY CODE FROM THESE .py SCRIPTS FOR USE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES!

I have published these scripts FREE OF CHARGE on github.com/bangstk/MPK2Plus
Usage of the scripts is intended for controlling Ableton Live with Akai MPK2
devices and for reference purposes (as there is very little public 
documentation on Ableton Live MIDI Remote Script code).

Selling this code or bundling it with a new device may fall afoul of Ableton
themselves!

If any Ableton or Akai employees wish to make my Ableton integration code
official for the MPK2 line, please contact me (bangstk on Github) and I
would be glad to re-create the code under a proper legal environment.
